# UFOs
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to use Javascript to create a table that organizes UFO sighting data that is stored as a JS arrat or list. This new table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria, such as city, state, date, country, and shape.

## Results
To filter the UFO data, type the desired criteria into the specified fields. There are example placeholder entries that are visisble in each of the fields to guide the user. Take the "Enter Date" field, for example. If you type in "1/7/2010", the table will update and return results after entering the search fields. If there are no matches, the table will return empty. 

## Summary
One drawback to this search is that the table is dynamically updated so there is no button that prompts the user to "filter data". It is not the most user-friendly. 
Two recommendations: 1) Sort it by data or country name, in ascending or descending order and 2) provide the option to view results by 25, 50, 100.
